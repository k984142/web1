  <h2>Java Script</h2> As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
  event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and
   prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text,
   arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but
    the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage,
     or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in
      which it is embedded.
